# Facebook Clone 
A simple, responsive Facebook Clone made using Typescript and React. 

I chose [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool for this project (Thanks [@karanpratapsingh](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/) for the recommendation!  🙌). It truly is blazing fast!⚡

Currently, I have implemented the feed update feature only, along with a widget. 

Deployed it using vercel [here](fb-clone-ayushiee.vercel.app)

## Running the project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

It runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
